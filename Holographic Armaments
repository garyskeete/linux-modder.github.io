To produce an alternative or complimentary position of holographic implementation of projected implementations that can assist soldiers police drones and other vehicles transportation and personnel in the clearing and deployment of weapons systems as a prerequisite and predetermination for landings associated with hostile fire and as an accompaniment to countermeasures.
The holograms dependent on stealth will levitate fly and scan areas deploy munitions and build structures such as runways islets and clear areas for camps set and extinguish fires communicate and use A.I. Machine learning Algorithms and use a teleportation of particles to permit for rapid self assembly polymerization carbon bonding and scaffold building for polymers ,concrete ,rock formation , fire water wood and earth and prepare by implementation meals and do cleanup and maintenance 
This will assist troops emergency services government and civilians as well as educational institutions and healthcare. Schematics to be planned on Github with aides from WATSON
