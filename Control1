For A.I. Drones robotic technologies
An experiment in swarming 
The collective horde of miniature flying drones which are coordinated with A.I to fly in formations the added implementation of lights lasers which when coupled with a backdrop of the double slit experiment mimics the time zones of the suns reflection on earth and with quantum technology on board each drone allows them to project the image of their likeness or any other and teleport it through time

The swarm could be integrated into 3D printing reconstructing scenarios past events and with that regenerative biology and medicine constructing synthetic life forms that communicate effectively the ability to build structures by emitting a self sourced from oxygen and precious stone gold or incorporation of mineral stone such as a chip of an asteroid to combine to form a synthetic polymer that can be converted into miniature circuits or DNA or any combination of element needed

The swarm could be used for surveillance or to monitor activity of ongoing investigations cold cases or since it is incorporated through time communicate effectively with future events and rebuild past histories to relevant conclusions.

The swarm could be used to monitor oceans trends meteorites earthquakes volcanic activity by projection of images due to qubit integration in time zone calendar integration

The swarm could be used as a security feature or as a search mechanism or as they can fly a gatherer of information discovery and research also currently being operated for light shows and integrated with human movement teleported projections

Drones can be sent into outer space to simulate and complete livable planet formation by self assembly and molecular construction the drones would act as go betweens for holographic colliders.
