Concept The aspect of the proton exhibiting forces because of its negative mass to revert to the mass of a photon which is zero thereby creating a scenario for weightlessness and levitation if the field can be expanded and controlled this can be demonstrated if a soldier in the field can sleep suspended in mid air by a field controlled by frequencies -also flight

The aspect of the levitation in the photon also contributing to flight and thereby creating with that realm a photon engine to propel vehicles ships spacecraft armoured vehicles planes Jetpacks parachuters helicopters all types of transportation levitated at speeds of immense proportions to create with correct scenario for speed of light transfer or for rocket propelled or jet propelled travel over land and sea and air thereby shorter in time duration in reaching target areas in reaching Mission controls speeding up deployment methods and saving on time at sea as well as providing a more efficient way of completing missions﻿

For weapons assistance in powering up levels of intensity  for sights laser and photon guided by entanglement sights over distances for snipers and riflemen as well as increased sweeping power of terrain by including the photon in a Grover’s algorithm to detect ieds mines and other explosives and explosive devices the photon could also be adapted to search for drugs weapons or hidden criteria by matching Grover’s algorithms and scent or DNA searches

In view of a weapons upgrade the magnification of power in the amount of firepower being utilized may give rise to needing only one bomb or even one multitasking weapon perhaps semi or fully robotic to do the job.
