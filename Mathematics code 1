If Light
Then
1. The properties of light and the increase in concentration to formulate sensation such a touch and heat variations the subjection to physics forces denoting mass
2. The mass being the totality of the composition of the light including its functioning capacity which may have a holographic AI computer for cognitive status.
And
If Particles
Then
1. The attachment of a particle to a source of microscopic light such as a photon. The teleportation of that photon to coincide with the integrated particle which is transferred through being affixed to the photon to another position mathematically.
2. Look closely at the current methods of placing a point on Cartesian mapping grid with pixels of light, ant minute particles attached that are teleported? Can you trace them? Order of reoccurrence mathematical formulas? 
Not
