Taking the mathematical grid that was applied in subways for bomb detection and detonation diffusing and counterterrorism anti crime and safety measures and take the scanning capabilities and adjust them to observe and interact with minute particles of dust powder and traces of gases liquids and microscopic entities. This would be helpful in containing a biological or chemical attack or warding off an epidemic perhaps even a cough or sneeze.
The approach to microscopic criteria if the technology is upgraded and fine tuned could be one of surpassing the blood brain barrier and non invasive robotic surgeries.-concepts by Ashworth Medicine
