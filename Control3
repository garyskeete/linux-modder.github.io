The distinguishing of materials and criteria that have been burnt or otherwise affected by some form of ordinance .
The look at residue from burnt criteria the look at the remnants of the cremated remains a look at the apoptosis and trauma involved in the retrieval of vital DNA involved in the fire the combustion issue reversed by animation in view of finding DNA Evidence of reanimated living genetics which in addition to stem cells reproductive biology and regenerative Medicine as well as resuscitation should hold merit.

A look at exploded ordinance from a still video pause in the suspended animation of the explosion see an you unscramble an egg? Taking the still from a picture of the event find by specialized camera any victims and realign their DNA by applying the principles of healing integrations such as self assembly polymerization and scaffolds with stem cell integration as well as afore mentioned techniques leading to Resuscitation reversal effects of the physics involved in the pressure of the explosion necessary.

Starting with physics at. Smaller designation a firecracker or sparkler that is emitting heat the objective to reverse the processes of the burn or explosion by gradually seeking to contain it with a mathematical grid hologram then by seeking to reverse the apoptosis of materials the remnants of the charring are re-established as functional by the adage of scaffolds at first then a theoretical proliferation of polymerized stable network of flammable explodable criteria then repair and reconstruction occurs in the reanimation of substances comprising the combustion or the explosion. All contained within a hologram comprised of string theory webwork of binding particles to formulate a disintegration net after explosion and reintegration

I would like to attempt a study based on the following

An attempt at restoring life through modern day techniques of lifesaving with adaptations

Machines  and techniques for Resuscitation
Inducing a coma like state into the deceased-simulation of life synthetic host based on patients DNA
Bath in detox like gel for reduction of decomposition
Stem cell integration to repair and reset injection into spinal column -Resuscitation 
Gestalt locator and compiler- particle inducement spectral analysis
 Hyper ventilator for breathing bariatric chamber
HydrooxyGenetics specialized infused water for revival based on amniotic fluid Artificial womb
Hydrooxygenetics
A water based amniotic fluid that is the enabler of reanimation reconstruction repair reconfiguration reassessment recollection re-creation molecular genetic and cellular the key points of integration for the fundamentals of support in the chemistry of life giving interactions the precursors for the prerequisites of homeostasis and the fundamentals of resuscitation. According to standards of holographic overlaid in a predictive model of mathematics and a frequency modulation according to waking up the tendencies that have the brain and body's frequencies at an uninterrupted continuum
Particle inducement simulator with illustrated animation-Biological Film Inplementation
Reanimation of cells molecular consistency DNA functioning- Regenerative Biology

Heart beat and circulatory support  pacemaker medical machine
Brain function cognition memory and recall computational neuroscience
Organ support and maintenance kidney liver pancreas functioning support for small intestine colon dialysis monitors flushing
Nutrition and digestion support stomach and body extremities reached feeding tube
Overall observance through  combination ultrasound/ MRI/Display Monitor
Restoration through application of removal from coma like state
Restoration of youth through cosmetic surgery plastic surgery liposuction and restorative balms creams lotions


Combination of these machines with interfaces and patches to permit the smooth integration from long since deceased to living with quality of life

These aspects should be considered before attempting resuscitation of long term deceased  as the supportive measures should last until the patient is fully restored and self supportive.

An attempt at Resuscitation by inducing a Qubit to have multifactorial importance and multifunctional influence the Qubit holographic will act as a base for cells DNA and molecular substances to proliferate
The mathematical configurement along with the holographic implementation of needed medical machines and implementations miniaturized to suit the microscopic criteria aforementioned should suffice to produce reanimation revival and resuscitation of individuals

‪Gary Skeete Qubits and Makey Makey - The Quantum Makey Makey‬

‪Scientific Questions‬
‪Can you use he QMM to project musical notes throughout the galaxy? Can it be used on bodies to remove tumours by adjusting to their frequencies and shrinking them?‬
‪Can it be used to rid the body by frequency adoption and elimination of a virus or disease?‬
‪Can you Makey Makey that? Wirelessly?‬

How about in addition to the aforementioned science an Arts application of Quantum Makey Makey
The usage of Memory for locale (in the future usage will be teleportation)
The usage of photonics combined with holographics for light displays
In the future starlight and sunlight will not only heal memory from their natural memory storage but power great machines that teleport people from supportive environments from supportive planet to planet in the universe 
The usage of music and wireless communication
 The usage of a webcam
Forthemusicbuffs
Putting on a global concert can be a reality with Quantum Makey Makey
Special effects lighting and backdrops made possible through portable projector ( in the future holographic mid air animation)

Suppose you could take a synthetic polymer that was as strong as steel and make a living synthetic cell by applying the polymer to synthetic biology making muscle tissue hearts organs designing brains with the capacity to interact at that level with the physical enhancements see Pinterest Super Soldier Program.

So a helium based interjection to float the remnants of the particles and contents in mid air by infusing underneath the remnants with a lighter than air gas a mathematical grid to scan for impurities and damage and with that scan an integration to repair through holographic scaffolds self assembly and stem cells and surgical glue integrating the mathematics to retrace the steps of the reversal process of the egg breaking put back together in its relevant entirety with improvements and enhancements to makeup for the trauma, then utilizing a larger concentration of helium float the egg back on the counter.
So utilize the mathematics to form a bond between the animation in reverse and reality
 This technique is utilized for the reasoning that an egg if repaired properly could give life to a living creature and the benefits of that knowledge to medical science
We would be better able to understand reproduction as repairing the egg would entail going full circle egg chicken egg to see conclusion and side effects if any from trauma.
Stresses trauma accidents assaults perhaps a vision into life after death
Developmental Technologies
Longevity anti aging immortality medicine resuscitation sciences
The result of looking as an example to tumourigenesis and damage in the prostate due to mutation or to trauma the calculated risk of foreign bodies or infection compounding damage and the possibilities of molecular surgeries their purpose reach and extent.

The aspect of teleportation and helium the agent for elevating elements and microscopic criteria to heights in the self assembly and translocation of regenerative biology of living entities be they synthetic natural metallic inorganic organic chemical elemental or compounds of solid liquid or gaseous.
The relevance of animation and holograms in the reversal of effects from one stage to another the purpose being the reversal of a crash scene an accident scene or the reversal of damage done by trauma to a body the reversal of microscopic elements to put them back in order reversing damage reversing stress reversing details of contamination or unwanted metastasis malignancy tumourigenesis or mutations reversal from stage four to stage zero cancer
So the details of the intrinsic interface between holograms animation To real to life situations placed in a overlay perhaps of suspended animation mix with augmented reality to overlay the intrinsic connection between The object being observed at the animation the connective Holographic A.I. location being the systematic bonding of elemental design to produce the effect of creating an object from animation to reality effects of illustration the effects of artistic rendering the effects of photographic memory the affects of copying transitioning and placing the object into a three-dimensional system of Cartesian mapping to create the correct scenario for holographic cloning in a sense of providing the synthesis of the correct chemical robotic holographic and biological sequences to produce a life form or living tissue.

So the reversal of animation of a dropped egg the distinct proposal of replacing and reformatting recovery repair and reconstruction of an otherwise unrecoverable subject matter 

The aspect of the reversal of animation involving fractal geometry from the inside out creating the template for modelling the microscopic criteria and characteristics of the subject matter. The usage of Hilbert Space to suggest a moment in time that denotes distinction in the separation and timing of looking at mechanisms which correlate to form collaborations in reconstruction repair reconfigurement reversal and resuscitation as well as regenerative recuperative reproductive processes.

The use of stem cells hematology the management of dotmatrix diagrams to represent a moment in time and cells the singling out of individual dots to invoke a series of modelling tests such as a ball or sphere along a möbius transformation

Application of particle physics and reverse time hologram for the unscrambling of an egg for the placement of a yolk back in the shell the application of a hologram resulting in reverse animation

Here's a conceptual adaptation of supramolecular brain surgery and enlargement of the skull

Can you unscramble an egg 
or put an eggshell back together with the yolk intact inside the application of going from a scrambled egg to egg yolk inside a complete eggshell going backwards through time can be achieved by animation the application being movie animated sequence of events going backwards through time and at the yolk returning to the shell of the intact egg
So with that application we have applications of pixels of light applying themselves in a synchronize matter to achieve the result of the reverse time application of the yolk being intact inside the egg and with that we have the mathematical calculations of the computer to show the final disposition of particles of parts of the eggshell parts of the yolk that are undergoing change and frequency of particle assimilation read adjustment of replacement mathematically would be the assessment needed to show where it polymerization and where in acquisition of parts of the eggshell mathematically by looking for  example at a puzzle that is put together then set apart then put together again and looking at the aspect of helium and self-assembly by perhaps nano bots  nanomedicine scaffolds that self dissect  and dissolve after bonding parts or by polymerization blown apart view in slow motion animation

This is what I have resolved in theory from your lecture above thank you for your precise calculations.

Moduli spaces of curves
When she speaks of "singularity"and"being hard to understand" I began to form a concept around Omega that involved not the ending of the source of the meaning which is God but the ending of the concept of revelation and on to a concept of a new beginning exponential mixing being the fast acceleration of the rapture and the quickness of a miracle one such miracle would be the genetics involved in the differentiation of cancer cells that are immortal and healthy cells that are immortal the. Hyperbolic Surface there being the cross section ImG of parallel lines in mathematics that graphically represent the genetic blends of both aforementioned. See

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_space

As you can see from the lone diagram constructing P1 R the line intersects at 0 having passed through a negative value and a positive value the negative value representing the cancer the positive the healthy cells and the 0 representing the ultimate goal of the stage of cancer.

The orbit in dynamics and science and mathematics representing the earth as a circle a globe with the representation of brain activity as spikes in quantum theory represented in a dynamical system based on complex quadratic polynomials psee

Non Uniform Hyperbolicity
Represents the turmoil insistent in the processes of the tribulations and persecutions in Revelations and  chaos can be counteracted by Miracles derived from Infinity or Heaven as derived and defined in the above website and coding.

Ergodic theory solution
The representations of physics as quantum theory in the application of qubits to formulate plans for placement and whereabouts actions and visuals of the functional Brain and spectral realm to insist upon the existence of Heaven.

Theta and Lambda
Representing the population going into different dimensions by vectors of string theory the resulting collaborations should be formidable

Subsurfaces disappearing
We have here the dimensional blend of virtual reality and other dimensions relating to particle theory and disintegrating to nothingness upon integration with known realities Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end.

The dynamics on the moduli spaces of curves representing the measurement of the curvature of earth by a parabola the pair of them which form a hyperbola as mentioned in coded mathematics.

"Things get closed on a stable manifold"
The diagram resembles a parabolic dish sending signals to infinity and back.The measurement of quantum signals for entanglement.Schrodingers cat. The representation of being alive being alive but dead in Heaven the physical body left for dead and resuscitation teleportation and time travel and transfer of the gestalt and out of body experiences. Also the aspect of brain activity after death.

Idea
If there is a sphere representing the world the net is the travel of spectres to different dimensions and if the sphere represents a hologram encasement the time coordinates of other involved new particles or elements is evident in entanglement or placement in a new dimension as represented by the net.
