Just like God made in his image 
the  military of the nation under him would have learned from revelation to keep the battlefield separate from the homeland would not have to move out only position themselves accordingly to match the coordinates of their proposed targets so that in virtual reality formation the teleported particle infused laser guided weaponry animation to reality could be utilized against the enemy
Virtual reality goggles
Photonics weapons dubbed light sabre weapons= these are rifles for example outfitted with light emitting tracers for target acquisitions the DNA equivalent of laser tag.
So the airforce could stay within their ranges for dogfighting in given areas and the enemy’s position would be tracked and matched with drones such as remote powered MIGS that are foreign.
A direct hit by laser in this case would automatically translate into actually shooting down the enemy simoustayineusly by teleportation

The bombs loaded on the stationary simulator would be real as flight crews allow but not explosive the warheads or c4 or explosives would be teleported to the dropped animation to reality bombs to proceed to target so all the flight maintenance crew would have to do is set up and replace burnt out models of bombs while the pilot sits in the cock pit working out coordinates and positioning for targets he’s /she’s still on base but the target is already destroyed- maybe a flight to go check.....
