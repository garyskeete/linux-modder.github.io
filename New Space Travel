As you read the articles a reference to past documentation is noted with respect to Google and Onedrive. The overall application takes the concept of building space platforms for memory the usage of the rotary for designing self assembly and compatibility in separate build-able solids such as intelligent scaffolds just add water respecting the knowledge that DNA folding can essentially retain its parameters and that the swarm algorithm could apply to space going medical drones we arrive at a new form of space travel
