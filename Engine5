Research Engine Technology
In early tests the military lifted a weight equivalent to that of a mountain with just one photon.and a condensed electromagnetic field frequency to create lift and levitation in a creative application reliant upon gravity condensed magnetism electricity and scaled to fit in a proton of a photon by mass which is minus decimal point on the proton leaving the mass of the photon at zero.
Again grafting a stacked speed of light according to Differential Calculus engine into the body of the Photon microscopically and enlarging the projection by enveloping the membrane of photon engines in a hologram to transmit holographic in the event of asymmetric threats

The threats analyzed by scanning mechanisms in the self contained self replicating omnidirectional multipurpose multi factor multi functional design technology engineering holograms that are adaptable and are consistent with technology mathematics and physics for the purpose of counterterrorism and countering the asymmetric threats in synchronicity.

The application of the speed of light calculations in Differential Calculus stacking up the speed of light and the wave function of light in a vacuum and particle physics engine design to produce an infinity related speed to counteract incoming threats in a predetermined exercise of targeting through crosshairs and scopes and helmet designed Trigonometry.

The advent of the technology solutions being applied to Predator and Reaper drone technologies to produce within the realm of acquisition a plan of action or tactics by reading and translating the frequencies of the brainwaves of the enemy and translating them into visuals that can be animated to match dream patterns or even conscious thought. Not only for biological specimens but for computer systems such as military and communications technology coding.
