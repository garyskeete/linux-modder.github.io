Hypothetically a Dysen dryer engine revolution at 18000 rps = translated to a 455 hp engine =68919 mph  be accelerated to a proton speed in a collider as an engine at 3 meters less than the speed of light times faster seeing that the collider speed of protons is almost the speed of light which is 673200000 mph
